 #H3  **Publish your literature thesis or internship report in a peer-reviewed journal**
#H2 **Major or Minor project?** = MAJOR

**Description:**
After your internship or finishing your literature study, you might discuss with your VU or On-site supervisor whether it's a possibility to transform your report into a manuscript, which can be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.
This falls outside the boundaries of a regular internship, despite the extra time investment, it is a really great professional opportunity for you.

**Your professional development:**
- Training your scientific writing and editing skills
- Learning more about the peer-review and publishing process first thand
- Participating in the peer-review process as an author
- Contributing to your field
- An authorship as peer-reviewed publication on your CV demonstrates project output, collaboration and evidence of writing.

**How could this work?** 
Your VU supervisor or the paper's senior author would act as your expert mentor and provide feedback on _how_ you worked towards this goal. 
You will need to start by determining what your role in this process will be. 
You will need to decide on the journal and format of the manuscript during your first meeting. 

**What should I provide for the portfolio?**
First know, publishing is often a lengthy process (taking months or, in some cases, years). 
Depending on your ambitions for choice of journal, or the back-and-forth of the peer-review process, it may take longer than your actual master's degree permits before the paper is finally published online.
But that doesn't preclude you from starting and using this as a major project in your portfolio. 

  **Evidence of Process:**
  - Submit the original report (the starting point) that you previosuly submitted for your internship or literature thesis.
  - Submit 2-3 redrafted versions of this as a manuscript, to show you've been working to transform the report. These submitted versions could also include the final proofs, but should aim to demonstrate _your own personal contribution_ to the writing process.
  - Download and submit the author guidelines for the journal to which you plan to submit.
  - Submit evidence of submission to a peer-reviewed journal (screenshots, emails) or an intention to submit statement (short note written & signed by your senior author) 
  
  **Evidence of Feedback:**
  - Submit emails communications or annotatations from senior (or other) authors on the paper and/or your expert mentor.
  - Submit notes you've taken yourself from meetings with authors, collaborators or your expert mentor (screenshots or photos)
  
**Assuming confidentiality**
We realize the publication process might involve sensitive or confidential information and data. 
For this reason, please ensure your collaborators and expert mentor are aware that you will use their feedback for reflection in your learning portfolio. You may use your own discretion for redacting names or confidential information where prudent. 
If your senior authors or expert mentor would prefer, you can also just provide a sample page of your manuscript or drafts with the appropriate redactions, and additionally submit a confidentiality statement from your mentor/senior author.
